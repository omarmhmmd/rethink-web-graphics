        <!-- <h1>About</h1> The grid has played a colossal role in the practice of graphic design since the Constructivist, De Stijl, and Bauhaus movements of the early 20th century presented a new form of design informed by the use of the grid. An underlying invisible
        structure that controls the display of content within two dimensions, the grid acts as an authoritarian figure creating an orderly system of visual information. Author of Grid Systems in Graphic Design (1981), Josef Müller-Brockmann states, “The
        use of the grid system implies the will to systematize…cultivate objectivity instead of subjectivity…and to rationalize the creative and technical production process…” (10). Although this tool and its techniques ultimately created the modern design
        language we witness today, it has stifled the growth of an environment only 28 years old: the Web. Designers of the Web today are constantly pushed to adhere to a grid based design, which is usually applied to a predisposed grid template created
        by a developer who has no training in the creative fields. This grid then informs the aesthetics, interface, and tangibility of a website. With template based services such as Bootstrap, WordPress, and Squarespace, the grid has further become
        a commoditized tool that takes away from the freedom, subjectivity, and creativity the Web has to offer. As graphic designers today are attempting to break the grid, so too are the designers of the web. The Rethink: Web logo was designed as a
        piece to reflect not only the ideologies behind Rethink: Web but as a symbol regarding the speculative future of the relationship between the Web and the grid. Individual pieces within the grid itself represent the constraint of the four cornered
        two dimensional screen all browsers adhere by. The organic curves and form generated through user input then create an abstracted grid that does not follow the basic ontology of a grid, stating there is room to modify the Web’s identity and its
        relationship to the grid and eventually morph to a new design paradigm. These grids are created through a set of user inputs: color, amount of rectangles to affect, and curvature of rectangles fed through a procedural generation algorithm. Through
        this web based application, designers of Rethink: Web are encouraged to create a new logo for each new design solution related to the program, allowing for the design system of Rethink: Web to be continuous and ever-changing, just like the Web. -->
